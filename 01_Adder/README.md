# üç≥ Concept of Adder

An adder is a digital circuit that performs addition of numbers.  
Adders are a fundamental component of an ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) in CPUs and other processing units.  
Adders can be designed to handle various bit-widths and can be optimized for speed and efficiency.  
There are different types of adders, each with its own design considerations and trade-offs.

# üö© Folder Descriptions

## [01_1-Bit Full Adder](./01_1-Bit%20Full%20Adder)

This directory contains the design and implementation of a 1-bit full adder.  
A full adder is a combinational circuit that adds three one-bit binary numbers (two significant bits and an input carry) and outputs a sum and a carry.  
The design includes:
- **Structural Modeling**: Using basic logic gates to build the full adder.
- **Dataflow Modeling**: Using continuous assignments to describe the behavior of the full adder.
- **Behavioral Modeling**: Using procedural statements (`always` blocks) to implement the full adder logic.

## [02_4-Bit Adder](./02_4-Bit%20Adder)

This directory contains the design of a 4-bit adder, which adds two 4-bit binary numbers and outputs a sum and a carry.  
The design is implemented using different modeling techniques:
- **Structural Modeling**: Building the 4-bit adder using four 1-bit full adders.
- **Dataflow Modeling**: Using continuous assignments to describe the behavior of the 4-bit adder.
- **Behavioral Modeling**: Using procedural statements (`always` blocks) to implement the adder logic.

## [03_4-Bit Ripple Carry Adder](./03_4-Bit%20Ripple%20Carry%20Adder)

This directory contains the design of a 4-bit ripple carry adder.  
A ripple carry adder is a chain of full adders where the carry output of each full adder is connected to the carry input of the next full adder.  
This design is efficient for small bit-widths but can be slow for larger bit-widths due to the propagation delay of the carry signal through each full adder.

## [04_N-Bit Adder](./04_N-Bit%20Adder)

This directory contains the design of an N-bit adder, which can handle any bit-width specified by a parameter.  
The design leverages different modeling techniques to ensure scalability and flexibility:
- **Generate Statement**: To create a scalable N-bit adder using parameterized modules.
- **Dataflow Modeling**: Using continuous assignments to describe the behavior of the adder.
- **Behavioral Modeling**: Using procedural statements (`always` blocks) to implement the adder logic with parameterization.

## [05_CarryLookAhead Adder](./05_CarryLookAhead%20Adder)

This directory contains the design of a Carry Look-Ahead (CLA) adder.  
The CLA adder improves speed by reducing the propagation delay associated with the carry signal in ripple carry adders.  
It uses generate and propagate signals to quickly determine the carry for each bit position, significantly enhancing performance for larger bit-widths.
