An Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a critical component of a CPU in any computer system.  
It performs both arithmetic and logical operations on the binary data inputs.  
The operations performed by an ALU can be broadly categorized into:

1. **Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. **Logical Operations**: AND, OR, NOT, XOR, etc.

The ALU receives input data and control signals that dictate which operation it should perform.  
The output is the result of the operation, which can be fed back into other parts of the computer system or used for further processing.
