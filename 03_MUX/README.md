# üç≥ Concept of MUX

A Multiplexer (MUX) is a combinational circuit that selects one of many input signals and forwards the selected input to a single output line. The selection of the input line is controlled by a set of selection lines. The key idea behind a multiplexer is to manage multiple data inputs while using fewer output lines, making it a crucial component in various digital systems, including data routing, signal multiplexing, and efficient resource utilization.

**Basic Operation**:
- **Selection Lines**: Determine which input line to send to the output.
- **Input Lines**: Multiple data inputs that the multiplexer can choose from.
- **Output Line**: Single output that carries the selected input signal.
